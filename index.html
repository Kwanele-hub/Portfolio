     <h1>KWANELE MKHWANAZI</h1>
     <h2>MY STORY</h2>
    <P>Hi everyone my name is Kwanele Mkhwanazi I was born in the province of KZN but raised in Gauteng that is where I got a living. 
         I was raised in a poor community but I managed to uplift myself. I went to school at Diepsloot Secondary School. While I was at school I had my ups and downs but I couldn't stop following my dreams. I failed my grade 11 so many times but that didn't stop me. 
         My last year at school we were given forms about the internship of the Coding Ground academy to fill in, luckily 
         I was called to do a scratch test which I manage to pass through. After one week we were told about the Bootcamp, truly speaking I never taught I was going to make it.
